  Provides copy memory, fill memory, zero memory, and GUID functions.
   
  The Base Memory Library provides optimized implementations for common memory-based operations. 
  These functions should be used in place of coding your own loops to do equivalent common functions. 
  This allows optimized library implementations to help increase performance.

  Copies a source buffer to a destination buffer, and returns the destination buffer.

  This function copies Length bytes from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer, and returns
  DestinationBuffer.  The implementation must be reentrant, and it must handle the case
  where SourceBuffer overlaps DestinationBuffer.
  
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - DestinationBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().
  If Length is greater than (MAX_ADDRESS - SourceBuffer + 1), then ASSERT().

  @param  DestinationBuffer   The pointer to the destination buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  SourceBuffer        The pointer to the source buffer of the memory copy.
  @param  Length              The number of bytes to copy from SourceBuffer to DestinationBuffer.

  @return DestinationBuffer.
